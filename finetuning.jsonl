How should dimension be defined?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "A reasonable definition should force the dimension of F^n to equal n. Thus we are tempted to define the dimension as the length of a basis. However, a finite-dimensional vector space in general has many different bases, and our attempted definition makes sense only if all bases in a given vector space have the same length. Fortunately that turns out to be the case."}]}

The length of a vector x is called the norm of x. Even though we cannot draw pictures in higher dimensions, we can generalize said notion to R^n. An inner product is a generalization of the dot product. At this point you may be tempted to guess that an inner product is defined by abstracting the properties of the dot product discussed in the last paragraph. For real vector spaces, that guess is correct. However, so that we can make a definition that will be useful for both real and complex vector spaces, we need to examine the complex case before making the definition."}]}

Determinants are difficult, nonintuitive, and often defined without motivation.

This tortuous (torturous?) path gives students little feeling for why eigenvalues exist."}]}
